# Preparation Project for the how.fm coding challenge
This project will help you to prepare your development environment for the actual how.fm coding challenge. This saves you precious time since the coding challenge is time limited.

- Correct Node version and global dependencies like yarn
- Running yarn will cache
- Get familiar with the npm scripts using yarn
- Get familiar with [Storybooks](https://storybook.js.org/)
- Get familiar with [Material UI](https://mui.com/). 
  - During the case study, we are using [MUI v4](https://v4.mui.com/).
  - And specifically: [Grid](https://v4.mui.com/components/grid/), [Styles](https://v4.mui.com/styles/api/#makestyles-styles-options-hook), [Select](https://v4.mui.com/components/selects/#select), [Dialog](https://v4.mui.com/components/dialogs/#dialog) 

## What will the actual coding challenge be about?
- You will receive access to your personal private GitHub repository that will contain the details about the task. Please, review the your emails for more details about the process.

- Update the visual design of a DropDown Component
- Enhance the functionality of the DropDown Component 
- Align the look of two other relevant Components
- Fix a “state” bug and others which are clearly identified
- Fix two warnings.
- There will be a task for React Hooks. 
- Bonus: Ideas on how to improve the code. 


## Applying for a role at how.fm
If you have not applied yet and you are interested...

## Getting Started

1. Checkout the main branch
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Make sure you run the correct Node version

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And enhanced with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

# Reference
Below you will find the scripts available in this project.

## Storybook scripts

#### `yarn storybook`

Runs the Storybook in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

#### `yarn build-storybook`

Builds the Storybook for production and deplyment.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

## Default Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## ⚠️ Dangerous scripts

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
